## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 15**: A React framework for production.
- **NextUI**: Component library for building modern web applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v22.8.0 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

Yarn is preferred, so now on it will be taken as reference.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Running the application

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:mandraghen/image-searcher.git
   cd image-searcher
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```
4. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
